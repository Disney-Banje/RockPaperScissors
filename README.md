# My First JavaScript Project

Hello, everyone! I am a beginner in JavaScript and I am currently working on my first serious project - a Rock Paper Scissors game. I would love to get some feedback from people as I'm still learning and I'm far from the finished product.

I understand that my code may not be perfect, but I'm willing to learn and improve. As a beginner, any advice, feedback, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to review my code and I hope to hear from you soon!
